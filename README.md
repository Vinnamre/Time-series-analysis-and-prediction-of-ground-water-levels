# Petrignano Aquifer Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the groundwater levels within the Petrignano aquifer system, located in the alluvial plain between Ospedalicchio di Bastia Umbra and Petrignano. The aquifer system is influenced by complex hydrogeological dynamics and is classified as a water table groundwater system. Its behavior is closely tied to the hydrology of the nearby Chiascio River.

## Key Features of the Dataset
The dataset includes observations and measurements that characterize the aquifer system, with the following key features:
- **Waterbody:** Petrignano
- **Type:** Aquifer
- **Description:**
  - The aquifer system comprises three distinct underground aquifers separated by low permeability septa.
  - Groundwater levels are directly influenced by the Chiascio River, indicating a significant hydrological interaction.

## Influencing Parameters
Groundwater levels in the Petrignano aquifer are influenced by several environmental and hydrological factors:

1. **Rainfall:**
   - Precipitation levels significantly affect groundwater recharge and levels.

2. **Depth to Groundwater:**
   - Variations in the depth of the water table influence the availability of groundwater resources.

3. **Temperatures:**
   - Seasonal and daily temperature changes impact evaporation rates, which, in turn, affect groundwater levels.

4. **Drainage Volumes:**
   - Management and volume of drainage in the area play a role in altering the hydrological balance.

5. **Level of the Chiascio River:**
   - Proximity to the Chiascio River and its water levels are critical in maintaining the groundwater balance of the aquifer.
